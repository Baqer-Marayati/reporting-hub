# Power BI Patterns

## Purpose
This file captures what we have learned about handling PBIP report files, TMDL semantic-model files, and repeated Power BI repair patterns in this project.

## PBIP File Handling
- PBIP report definitions are editable and useful when a visual's structure is understood clearly.
- Report-side JSON edits are often the safest way to fix bindings, filters, slicer layout, and repeated styling patterns.
- Repeated visual patterns should be repaired as systems, not one screenshot at a time.
- Page and visual JSON should be read before making assumptions about what Power BI is actually doing.
- `PBIP` should remain the development master even when a `PBIX` review snapshot is created for convenience or faster server transfer.
- If a `PBIX` review copy exists, treat it as disposable output, not as the place where new fixes should live.

## TMDL Handling
- TMDL is useful for adding compatibility tables, measures, and semantic aliases.
- Custom relationship edits are high risk in this project because Power BI has already rejected some with invalid column-ID errors.
- Compatibility logic is acceptable when it helps a page bind and render, but it must be labeled clearly if it is not real SAP business truth.
- When a semantic-model change causes load instability, stabilize the PBIP first before continuing design polish.

## Safe Repair Order
1. inspect the page and visual JSON
2. inspect the bound table or measure in TMDL
3. decide whether the problem is:
   - stale benchmark binding
   - filter/drillthrough problem
   - disconnected helper object
   - missing SAP truth
   - compatibility-layer weakness
4. fix the safest layer first
5. reopen the PBIP and verify with screenshots

## Report-Side Discoveries
- Hard-coded benchmark drillthrough filters can silently break otherwise valid pages.
- Slicer polish sometimes requires structural changes such as separating labels from controls.
- IQD formatting affects layout; a card that fit in USD may crowd in IQD.
- KPI rows and slicer rails should be treated as reusable components across pages.
- If two pages answer the same question with nearly the same visual, reassign one of them to a different business angle instead of keeping both. In the current 7-page set:
- `Income Statement` should own profitability mix
- `Revenue Insights` should own sales-type revenue mix
- `Cost Structure` should own department-opex concentration
- `Executive Overview` should summarize by sales type rather than repeat department opex
- The cleanest slicer rail in this report uses separate text labels plus compact dropdowns. Copy that pattern to older sidebar pages instead of trying to force a native slicer header to look elegant.
- `Performance Details` is the visual master for the five-control left sidebar rail. Matching it means matching not only label/dropdown positions, but also removing extra slicer-level styling overrides so the controls render with the lighter default look.

## Model-Side Discoveries
- Working top cards usually mean the business domain exists; lower broken visuals often point to wiring problems, not missing SAP data.
- AP and AR pages are more stable when kept close to single-table behavior.
- Cross-domain compatibility aliases can create circular dependency risks.
- Cashflow and budget pages should not be described as source-of-truth if they still rely on compatibility logic.
- If a warning icon survives several report-side fixes, look for a compatibility table that still depends on another compatibility table. Flattening those dependencies back to `Fact_PNL` or another real fact is often the real fix.
- If a warning icon persists on both a source compatibility table and a downstream helper table, rebuild the downstream helper from the fact tables directly rather than waiting for the upstream warning to disappear.

## Design Discoveries
- The preferred design language is quiet, executive, and benchmark-led.
- Sample 2 is the strongest shell reference and should continue to guide layout, spacing, and page composition.
- Light theme nudges rarely overcome strong local visual formatting.
- Structural consistency matters more than flashy changes.

## Working Style Discoveries
- The best workflow is iterative and evidence-based: change, reopen PBIP, inspect, then refine.
- Screenshots are essential for confirming what Power BI actually rendered.
- Project Memory should be treated as retained learning, not just status tracking.
- Delivery convenience and development truth should be separated: single-file review copies are fine, but the structured PBIP project is still the reliable build surface.
