# Next Steps

## Immediate Priority
1. Reopen the PBIP after each semantic-model pass and capture screenshots of the remaining broken pages.
2. Recheck whether the right-pane warnings for `generalLedgerEntries` and `accounts` are gone after the latest cleanup pass.
3. Recheck the rewired monetary KPI cards on the 5 core finance pages and confirm the explicit title is clean and the values now render with the intended two-decimal compact behavior such as `2.00bn د.ع.‏`.
4. Reopen `Actual vs Budget` and confirm the page is stable after the dimension-slicer removal and interaction cleanup.
5. Reopen `Cashflow` and confirm the corrected `CashflowPeriod` binding and lower-section cards/charts render without stale errors.
6. Keep the new root `README`, `docs/`, and GitHub templates aligned with any future project-direction changes so repository onboarding does not drift away from `Project Memory`.
7. Start using the new `docs/workflows/` and `docs/standards/` files as the default lightweight reference layer before deeper repair work.
8. Keep the new GitHub issues current as work advances so the repo stays operational and later threads can pick up from issue state instead of reconstructing priorities from chat.

## Page-Specific Guidance

### Actual vs Budget
- Treat current budget as compatibility-only.
- Keep the page working, but do not represent the current logic as confirmed SAP budget truth.
- Watch for stale visual-level filters and benchmark placeholder defaults before assuming the measures are wrong.
- The page no longer needs the old `Dimension` slicer in the current live shell unless a future redesign deliberately brings back a dimension-driven comparison visual.

### Cashflow
- Current page can be stabilized with compatibility logic.
- If the business later wants true bank cash movement, build a real SAP-backed bank/cash fact.
- The existing cashflow visuals depend on helper-date flags; keep those helper columns in place unless the visuals are explicitly rewired away from them.
- The `CashflowPeriod` slicer should be treated as suspect if screenshots still show no effect; its report binding was stale and was corrected in the latest pass, but the business logic behind it is still lightweight.

## Future SAP Buildouts
- Native budget domain
- True bank / cash movement fact

## Done Criteria For Future Threads
- PBIP opens cleanly.
- The targeted page renders without broken visuals.
- Currency formatting is consistent in IQD.
- Project Memory is updated before the thread is considered done.
