# Decisions

## Active Project
- Active working project: `/Users/baqer/Dropbox/Work/PowerBI/Al Jazeera Reporting Hub/Financial Report`
- Do not create parallel experiment folders unless explicitly needed.

## Source Of Truth
- The financial PBIP project is the source of truth.
- The older sales-report experiments are not part of the active workflow.

## Delivery Format Rule
- `PBIP` remains the only working source of truth for this project.
- `PBIX` may be produced as a temporary review or transfer snapshot when a single-file handoff is more practical.
- Do not treat a review `PBIX` as the editable master.
- If a `PBIX` is created for review, all real changes must still be made back in the `PBIP` project.
- Use `PBIX` for convenience; use `PBIP` for development truth.

## Project Memory Rule
- `PROJECT_DNA.md` is a living project memory.
- Update it only at meaningful milestones or when an important conclusion changes.
- Do not turn it into a changelog.
- Keep the memory files together inside a dedicated `Project Memory` folder.

## Design Direction
- Use `Design Benchmarks` as the visual benchmark.
- Use the strongest available benchmark PBIP as the design base when a full benchmark file exists.
- Prefer benchmark-led rebuild over trying to slowly restyle heavily formatted legacy visuals.
- Preserve a CFO / management-report tone and avoid flashy dashboard styling.
- Treat repeated layout elements such as slicer rails and KPI rows as reusable patterns that should be standardized across pages.

## Records Benchmark Rule
- `Design Benchmarks` is a living benchmark folder.
- New screenshots, templates, and taste changes may override older visual assumptions.
- Before major design work, re-check `Design Benchmarks`.
- If the benchmark changes meaningfully, update `REFERENCE.md` and `PROJECT_DNA.md`.

## Active Benchmark
- As of March 20, 2026, `Design Benchmarks/Sample 2` is the active benchmark.
- It should be treated as the baseline report shell for layout, theme, and visual language.
- Screenshots are useful, but a benchmark PBIP is materially better and should be preferred whenever available.

## Logic Before Styling
- Priority is logic first, styling second.
- Keep the current Sample 2 visual direction unless a later benchmark update replaces it.
- Do not spend time on cosmetic tuning while benchmark pages still have broken bindings, missing measures, or invalid semantic objects.

## Broken Page Rule
- Broken Sample 2 pages are to be kept and repaired, not deleted.
- If a benchmark page is visually correct but semantically broken, preserve the shell and rewire the bindings to SAP-backed facts and measures.
- Prefer report-side rewires and safe semantic-model aliases before attempting risky custom relationship additions.

## Final Page Set
- As of March 21, 2026, the report is intentionally reduced to 7 live pages only:
- `Executive Overview`
- `Income Statement`
- `Revenue Insights`
- `Cost Structure`
- `Balance Sheet`
- `Actual vs Budget`
- `Cashflow`
- Pages outside that set are no longer part of the active report shell and should not be reintroduced unless explicitly requested.

## SAP Domain Rule
- Assume anything needed from SAP is available unless proven otherwise.
- Do not wait for the user to hand-build AR, AP, cashflow, commitment, or budget domains manually.
- It is acceptable to derive new SAP-backed fact tables directly from SAP Business One tables when needed.

## Budget Rule
- As of March 20, 2026, native SAP budget is not yet confirmed inside the semantic model.
- The current `glBudgetEntries` layer is a compatibility placeholder, not confirmed real budget.
- Budget visuals may be wired temporarily for layout continuity, but they should be clearly treated as provisional until a real SAP budget source is implemented.

## Currency Rule
- All report pages should use Iraqi dinar presentation consistently.
- If a benchmark page or imported visual still uses dollar formatting, convert it to IQD formatting during repair.
- Do not leave the first page set in IQD and the benchmark-derived page set in USD.
- Treat IQD formatting as both a business rule and a layout rule, because the suffix affects visual fit and card balance.

## PBIP Editing Rule
- PBIP report JSON can be edited directly when the visual pattern is understood and the change is deliberate.
- Report-side visual rewires are generally safer than semantic relationship experimentation.
- Broad style improvements should be applied as repeated-pattern fixes, not isolated screenshot patches.
- If a styling issue survives a basic size tweak, prefer structural changes such as moving titles outside controls or standardizing repeated geometry.

## Semantic Safety Rule
- Be cautious with compatibility aliases that bridge domains in both directions.
- If a compatibility measure creates a circular-feeling dependency path, prefer rewiring the report visual directly to the source table instead of keeping the alias.
- Do not blindly add custom relationships in TMDL when Power BI has already shown invalid-column-ID failures for the same approach.

## Memory Maintenance Rule
- The `Project Memory` folder must be updated whenever the semantic model, page-repair status, benchmark direction, or major assumptions change.
- Future threads should treat memory updates as part of done-ness, not as an optional last step.
- Add new markdown files when they materially improve continuity for later build threads.
- Consolidate durable discoveries into the right memory files instead of letting them remain trapped in chat history.

## Rebuild Rule
- If the existing report is resisting design changes, do not spend multiple passes on low-impact theme edits.
- Start from the benchmark report layer and rewire it to the active semantic model instead.
- Rebuild the report shell first, then remap fields and measures page by page.

## Report Swap Rule
- A full report-folder swap is acceptable when the benchmark PBIP is the intended base and the semantic model path is rewired correctly in `definition.pbir`.
- Keep a backup of the prior `.Report` folder before doing a full swap.

## Records Folder
- Store screenshots, templates, references, and inspiration files in `/Users/baqer/Dropbox/Work/PowerBI/Al Jazeera Reporting Hub/Design Benchmarks`.
