# Finance Report Module

This module is the working home for the Al Jazeera financial reporting project in Power BI inside the larger Reporting Hub portfolio.

The project combines:
- an active SAP-backed PBIP report in `Financial Report`
- a living visual benchmark in `Design Benchmarks`
- durable working memory in `Project Memory`

## Repository Purpose

Use this repository to:
- track report and semantic-model changes safely with Git
- keep the project backed up on GitHub
- document the current structure, assumptions, and operating workflow
- preserve continuity between repair, modeling, and design threads

## Active Project

The active editable report is:
- `Financial Report/Financial Report.pbip`

The active benchmark is:
- `Design Benchmarks/Sample 2`

## Working Areas

- `Core`
  - Shared domain baseline for cross-company Finance reporting assets.
  - Transitional note: active PBIP currently remains under `Financial Report` until migration is complete.
- `Companies`
  - Company-specific config and optional overlays.
- `Financial Report`
  - Active PBIP source of truth for report and semantic model work.
- `Design Benchmarks`
  - Living design reference and benchmark shell source.
- `Project Memory`
  - High-signal working memory for current status, decisions, risks, and next steps.
- `docs`
  - Repo-facing documentation for setup, structure, data context, and page intent.
- `scripts`
  - Packaging, capture, retention, and validation automation for this module.
- `.github`
  - Templates for structured pull requests and issue tracking.

## Start Here

If you are continuing work on this project, read these in order:
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
- [`docs/foundation.md`](docs/foundation.md)
- [`docs/setup.md`](docs/setup.md)
- [`docs/structure.md`](docs/structure.md)
- [`docs/agent-manual.md`](docs/agent-manual.md)

- [`Project Memory/NEXT_STEPS.md`](Project%20Memory/NEXT_STEPS.md)

## Working Rules

- Treat `Financial Report` as the only active editable report.
- Treat `PBIP` as the source of truth; use `PBIX` only as a temporary review copy if needed.
- Use `Design Benchmarks/Sample 2` as the active visual benchmark unless memory says otherwise.
- For packaging/review, use `Reports/Finance/scripts/package-report.ps1` and review `Exports/Server Packages/latest/Financial Report - ready.zip`.
- Run `Reports/Finance/scripts/validate-artifact-state.ps1` when behavior looks inconsistent to confirm you are editing/reviewing the intended artifact paths.
- Update `Project Memory` after meaningful technical or design changes.
- Keep Git commits small and descriptive.
- Treat repeated UI patterns like KPI rows and slicer rails as shared systems; fix them consistently across pages instead of one card or one screenshot at a time.

## Git Workflow

Typical workflow:

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the change"
git push
```

## Current State

The current live state of the project is maintained in:
- [`Project Memory/CURRENT_STATUS.md`](Project%20Memory/CURRENT_STATUS.md)

Use `Project Memory` for evolving truth.
Use `AGENTS.md` for AI onboarding.
Use `README` and `docs` for orientation and stable repo documentation.
