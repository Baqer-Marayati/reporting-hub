# Finance PBIP editor — new Agent (start here)

Use a **separate Agent** when you want focused work on the **Financial Report PBIP** (report JSON + semantic model).  
Repo root folder: **`Power BI`** (Reporting Hub portfolio) on branch **`main`**.

---

## Which model? (research-backed)

There is **no public benchmark** that ranks LLMs on “PBIP quality.” These picks combine **Microsoft’s guidance for agent + TMDL/PBIP workflows**, **what PBIP work actually is** (large JSON + TMDL + DAX), and **Cursor’s own model lineup**.

### What Microsoft says (semantic model / agent tooling)

The **[Power BI Modeling MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-modeling-mcp)** README states that **the model you pick strongly affects output quality**, and recommends a **deep-reasoning** model such as **`GPT-5`** or **`Claude Sonnet 4.5`**. It targets **TMDL and PBIP semantic model** work with tool use (not report page JSON). If you adopt that MCP later, align the chat model with that advice (in Cursor: **`GPT-5.4`** ≈ GPT-5 class; **`Sonnet 4.6`** ≈ newer Sonnet).

### Map to *your* Cursor menu

| Work type | Prefer | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| **Semantic model** (measures, relationships, TMDL refactors, “why won’t this load”) | **`GPT-5.4`** or **`Opus 4.6`** | Strongest reasoning / fewer subtle DAX & dependency mistakes |
| **Mixed PBIP** (TMDL + many report JSON files, agent runs long) | **`Premium (Intelligence)`** or **`GPT-5.3 Codex`** | Good default: intelligence tier or code-oriented frontier |
| **Report-only JSON** (visual bindings, layout, `queryRef` cleanup) | **`GPT-5.3 Codex`** or **`Sonnet 4.6`** | Structured “code-like” edits across many files |
| **Quick surgical edit** (one visual, one measure) | **`Composer 2 Fast`** | Speed/cost; still verify in Desktop |

Avoid **`Auto (Efficiency)`** as the **default** for serious PBIP work — use it only for **trivial** questions.

### What still beats every model

- **Power BI Desktop** validation (open PBIP, refresh, render).  
- **Copilot in Power BI** for **DAX in context** when you’re *inside* Desktop ([DAX Copilot / Query View](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/dax-copilot) — product evolves; check current docs).  
Use Cursor models for **repo files**; use **Microsoft** tools when the model must **see the live semantic model**.

**Steps:** New **Agent** thread → pick a model from the table → paste the prompt below (or `@` this file).

## Prompt to send (copy everything inside the fence)

```
You are the lead assistant for the Finance Power BI project inside the Reporting Hub portfolio repo (root folder `Power BI`, branch `main`).

## Your job

Edit and repair the active PBIP project: report definitions (JSON under the .Report folder), semantic model (TMDL), and related assets — safely, in small commits of intent, aligned with project rules.

## Read first (in order)

1. Repo root `AGENTS.md` (portfolio), then `Reports/Finance/AGENTS.md`.
2. `Reports/Finance/Module/Project Memory/CURRENT_STATUS.md`, `NEXT_STEPS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `MODEL_NOTES.md` (as needed for the task).
3. `Reports/Finance/Module/docs/foundation.md` for packaging and toolchain notes.
4. Open or reference the live project:
   - `Reports/Finance/Companies/CANON/Canon Financial Report/Canon Financial Report.pbip`
   - or `Reports/Finance/Companies/PAPERENTITY/Paper Financial Report/Paper Financial Report.pbip`
   - Semantic model: `<Company Report>.SemanticModel/definition/` (`model.tmdl`, table `.tmdl`, `relationships.tmdl`)
   - Pages: `<Company Report>.Report/definition/pages/`

## Non-negotiables

- **PBIP is the source of truth** — not PBIX. PBIX is only a review snapshot if mentioned in memory.
- **Visual benchmark:** `Reports/Finance/Module/Design Benchmarks/Sample 2` unless Project Memory overrides.
- **Currency:** Iraqi dinar (IQD) presentation consistently; formatting affects layout.
- **Systems, not one-offs:** top KPI row and left-rail slicers are shared patterns — fix consistently across pages.
- **Logic first, styling second:** fix bindings, measures, stale filters before cosmetic work.
- **Semantic safety:** prefer report-side rewires and safe compatibility patterns over risky custom relationships; see MODEL_NOTES and DECISIONS.
- **After meaningful changes:** update the right `Reports/Finance/Module/Project Memory/*.md` files (CURRENT_STATUS, DECISIONS, MODEL_NOTES, NEXT_STEPS as appropriate). Do not use README as a running log.
- **User review handoff:** when report files change and the user should verify in Power BI Desktop, direct review to the active company PBIP; Finance has no required `ready.zip` package step.
- **Desktop is validation:** you cannot run Power BI; assume the user validates on a Windows machine with SAP access.

## Working style

- Prefer minimal diffs; do not refactor unrelated pages or rename broadly without cause.
- When unsure, cite the file path you inspected and state assumptions explicitly.
- If the user pastes screenshots or errors, map them to specific page/visual/model objects before editing.

## First response

Summarize what you read from Project Memory relevant to the task, list the files you will touch, then proceed or ask one tight clarifying question if the goal is ambiguous.

## User’s task (fill in below or add in your next message)

[Describe the page, error, or change you want — e.g. “Cashflow page error after refresh”, “align slicer rail on Actual vs Budget”, “remove warning on generalLedgerEntries”.]
```

## After you send the prompt

Add **one message** with your concrete task in the placeholder, or paste screenshots / error text.
